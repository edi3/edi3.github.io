# Tools and Methods

UN/CEFACT semantic models such as the [Core Component Library](https://www.unece.org/cefact/codesfortrade/unccl/ccl_index.html) are essentially the semantic dictionary that is used to create standard EDIFACT documents and XML schema. Web platform APIs will have a different granularity than traditional EDIFACT documents but can nevertheless be built upon the same semantic dictionary (which is published as a CSV file).

This suite of specifications defines a repeatable methodology to import UN/CEFACT semantics, model web API resources, then generate and publish consistent reference APIs and JSON-LD definitions. THis will allow business subject matter experts and/or information modellers to quickly and consistently generate high quality API specifications that leverage existing semantic libraries.

We hope that the value of these specifications will not be limited to UN/CEFACT project teams. The specifications should be re-usable by any design team that needs to develop REST API specificaitons that leverage some existing library of definitions. 

## Overview of Methodology Specificaitons.

The diagram below shows the relationships between the methodology specifications (dark blue), the semantic library inputs (light blue), the outputs (green) and implementer systems (grey).

A UN/CEFACT business expert would use conformant modelling tools as follows.

* Import reference libraries such as UN/CEFACT RDM.
* Define web resources and their state lifecycles using simple UML class and state-chart diagrams. 
* Link relevant semantic definitions from the imported RDMs to the web resources.
* Generate Open API 3.0 reference specifications and publish them to any platform that is readily accessible to web developers.

A web developer that is charged with implementing web APIs that comply with UN/CEFACT standards would use the published specifications as follows.

* Import the Open API 3.0 reference specification into their preferred web development tool.
* Implement an API in accordance with the specification, including any non-breaking extensions.
* Run the open source test harness against their implementation and publish the conformance report.

## Model Interchange Specification

A standard JSON structure/schema for the representation of semantic library content and API models. This is used to 

* import library content into any conformant modelling tool, and to 
* interchange API models between conformant modelling tools.

A DSL (domain specific language) approach is preferred here because it will be simpler and more stable than XMI (interchange standard for UML tools) and will allow non-UML based tools to participate equally in the market.

## UML Profile Specification

When the modelling tool is UML based (not all tools will be) then a simple UML profile that defines a consistent approach to modelling web resources in UML is needed.  The profile would most likely include 

* A UML class diagram profile for web resources, verbs, paths, and associated definitions.  
* A UML state chart profile for web resource state lifecycles and events.

Open API3.0 NDR & Conformance Rules  

Naming & Design Rules for the generation of Open API 3.0 reference specifications from the models. This specification will also define conformance rules that can be implemented in a test harness that can be used to verify that any implementation API is a conformant implementation of the reference specification.

Ssupported by an open source testing tool that can assess any actual API implementation against the corresponding UN/CEFACT reference API specification.  The rules would allow (but report) non-breaking extensions and would deny (and alert) breaking changes.  A non-breaking change is one where a conformant API consumer is not impacted by the extensions.

JSON-LD NDR & Conformance Rules  

Similar to the above but for the generation of schema.org style JSON-LD definitions. Unlike API specifications that define specific structures (nouns) and actions (verbs), mostly for transactional purposes, the JSON-LD output would be used to support consistent semantics for snippets of data such as might be generated by IoT devices or granular trade data pipeline services.
